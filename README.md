# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
This project aimed to develop a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using EasyOCR and the extracted information had to save into a database along with the uploaded business card image, and require to make changes in database data as required.

## About EasyOCR
In today's fast-paced business environment, efficiently managing and organizing contact information is crucial for successful networking and communication. With the advent of digital tools and technologies, manual entry of business card details into a database can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To overcome these challenges, developers can leverage the power of optical character recognition (OCR) and databases to automate the process of extracting relevant information from business cards and storing it for easy access.

One powerful OCR library that facilitates the extraction of text from images is EasyOCR. EasyOCR is an open-source Python library that utilizes deep learning models to accurately recognize and extract text from various languages. By integrating EasyOCR with a MySQL database, developers can streamline the process of capturing business card data and storing it in a structured and organized manner.

-The dependencies on the EasyOCR package are minimal, making it easy to configure your OCR development environment.
-The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.
-Once EasyOCR is installed, only one import statement is required to import the package into your project.
-From there, all you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.
